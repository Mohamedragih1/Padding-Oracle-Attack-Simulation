# Padding-Oracle-Attack-Simulation
This project demonstrates a padding oracle attack simulation, where an adversary is able to recover plaintext from ciphertext without access to the encryption key. By exploiting responses from padding validation, the adversary learns information about the underlying message, illustrating a critical vulnerability in certain encryption schemes.
